# Klio Lambda SDK Developement Documentation

The documents in this folder will help you get familiar with [Klio](Klio.md) and how to build a program in python to analyze your data using the forms present in Klio.

The programs that you can run on Klio are called [Lambdas](Lambda.md). Each Lambda is a small program that is executed by Klio forms.


[Contracts.md](Contracts.md)

This SDK comes with multiple [examples](Examples.md) of lambda functions to show you simple form tasks to complex analysis of DICOM files.
